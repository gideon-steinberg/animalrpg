# animalrpg

A fun project I did to learn ReactJS.

It is a single page application hosted in S3.

A "Non-Competetive animal rpg with many cute animals". That sums it up right?

To run the development environment run `npm start`.
To run a production build run `npm run build`.

I wouldn't look too hard at the code though :smile:

## Leaving the following in as it is useful:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
